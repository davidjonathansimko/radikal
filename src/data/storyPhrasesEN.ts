  // === INTRODUCTION ===
  { main: 'The Power of Words:', sub: 'Why "radical" frightens people' },
  { main: 'When I first spoke with someone about the word "radical," I received a rather negative and distant reaction.', sub: null },
  { main: 'I realized then that the people around us \u2013 shaped by the media and politics \u2013 are often afraid of the word "radical." Why?', sub: null },
  { main: 'Because in our modern world it is used almost exclusively in a negative context: in connection with extremism, intolerance, and a readiness for violence.', sub: null },
  { main: 'This misunderstanding has historical and societal reasons:', sub: null },

  // === REASONS ===
  { main: 'Negative connotation through extremism: Political and religious groups that commit extreme acts (e.g., terrorism, fanaticism) are labeled "radical."', sub: 'The media often uses the word in connection with threat and danger, so it has absorbed these negative meanings.' },
  { main: 'Fear of change: "Radical" means a fundamental change. Many people perceive profound, rapid changes as frightening or destabilizing.', sub: null },
  { main: 'False interpretation as "extreme" instead of "fundamental": The original meaning "belonging to the root" (from the Latin "radix") has been replaced by the meaning "going to the extreme."', sub: 'It is no longer understood as a return to the essence, but as a deviation into the extreme.' },

  // === BIBLICAL RADICALITY DEFINITION ===

  { main: '"He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad."', sub: 'Matthew 12:30' },
  { main: 'Jesus demands a decision that allows no middle ground. Neutrality does not exist in the Kingdom of God:', sub: null },
  { main: 'This is radical because it divides the entire existence of man into one of two categories and demands a passionate, exclusive devotion to His Word.', sub: null },
  { main: 'There is no neutral ground, regardless of what is preached or told today \u2013 Jesus was once and for all clearly definitive in His statement!', sub: null },

  // 2. Violence or Obedience?
  { main: '2. Violence or Obedience?', sub: null },
  { main: '"And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers\' money, and overthrew the tables; And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father\'s house an house of merchandise."', sub: 'John 2:14-16' },
  { main: 'His radical action was often misunderstood and seen as a threat to the established religious order. An example of this is the cleansing of the temple, when he drove out the merchants and money changers (John 2:13-16).', sub: null },
  { main: 'The Jewish leaders saw this as an extremist act of disruption and authority usurpation, while Jesus was seeking the restoration of the original purpose of the house of God as a place of prayer \u2013 a return to the root of true worship and obedience to Scripture.', sub: null },
  { main: 'His "radicality" was therefore not a revolution through violence, hatred, or malice, but a renewal through the Word of God.', sub: null },

  { main: '"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it."', sub: 'Matthew 16:24-25' },
  { main: 'Jesus makes clear that following Him requires the surrender of one\'s own self and the willingness to suffer. This goes against every human instinct of self-preservation.', sub: null },

  { main: '5. Sin Tolerance?', sub: null },

  { main: 'In the parable of the Last Judgment, Jesus separates people into two groups based on their deeds of mercy (obedience to the Word in practice). Those who rejected him are confronted with a final judgment.', sub: null },
